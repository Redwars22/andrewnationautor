                        <strong>All Miguel ever wants is to resolve the internal conflicts that prevent him from being
                            happy, to have a decent father who is his best friend, and to be loved.</strong>
                        <p>Haunted by the scars of a troubled childhood and adolescence, Miguel embarks on a journey of
                            self-discovery as he enters the world of Computer Engineering at the University of Regente
                            do
                            Sul. His passion for technology and gaming draws him closer to Anne, his future soulmate,
                            whose
                            gentle nature and quiet strength challenge his carefully constructed solitude.
                        </p>
                        <p>As Miguel navigates the complexities of adulthood, the joys of newfound love, and the
                            challenges
                            of adjusting to his mother's new relationship, his resilience is put to the test. Just as he
                            begins to find solace in the stability of his new life, a devastating climate catastrophe
                            shatters his fragile peace, threatening everything he holds dear.</p>
                        <p>Amidst the chaos and uncertainty, Miguel must summon the courage to confront the past,
                            embrace
                            the present, and pave the way for a brighter future.</p>
